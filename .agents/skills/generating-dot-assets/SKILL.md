# Dot Asset Generator

Create transparent pixel-art object assets from a natural-language subject and an exact target size such as `32x32`, `64x64`, or `96x48`.

Use this skill when the user asks for a game object, sprite-like prop, item icon, diorama object, or transparent pixel-art asset generated from image generation.

## Environment requirements

- An image-generation tool callable from the agent. The bundled workflow assumes Codex's built-in `image_gen` and reads its output from `$CODEX_HOME/generated_images/...`. On other hosts (Codex, plain CLI), substitute an equivalent generator and copy the chosen image into `<PROJECT_DIR>/assets/source/<stem>.raw.png`.
- ImageMagick `convert` on PATH. The bundled `scripts/*.mjs` shell out to it; if it is missing, stop and report the dependency rather than fabricating output.

## Inputs

Require:

- subject, e.g. `old wooden school desk`
- final size, e.g. `64x64`
- output path or output directory

Optional:

- style notes
- palette JSON with a `colors` array
- raw output directory
- color count
- chroma-key color
- fit mode: `contain` or `stretch`

Default project layout:
- Use `<PROJECT_DIR>/assets/source/` for prompt records, copied raw images, cutouts, pixelized intermediates, and optional palette JSON files.
- Use `<PROJECT_DIR>/assets/sprites/` for final validated transparent PNGs.
- Use `<stem>.prompt.md`, `<stem>.raw.png`, `<stem>.cutout.png`, `<stem>.pixel.png`, and `<stem>.palette.json` for generated working files.
- If the final filename already exists and overwrite was not explicitly requested, use `<stem>_v2.png`, then `_v3`, etc. Apply the same suffix to prompt, raw, cutout, pixel, and palette files for that run.
- For role-based game assets, read `<PROJECT_DIR>/VISUAL_DESIGN.md` or the README visual direction first. Explicit user or scenario constraints may be used when those files are unavailable; report the missing design docs and record the constraints in the prompt file. If neither design docs nor explicit constraints define role colors, run `directing-game-visuals` first or define a minimal Player / Danger / Reward palette before generating.

## Workflow

1. Prompt built-in `image_gen` for an oversized source image of exactly one object.
2. Use a flat chroma-key background, usually `#00ff00`; use `#ff00ff` if the subject is green.
3. Copy the selected generated image from `$CODEX_HOME/generated_images/...` into the project raw directory.
4. Run `scripts/cutout.mjs` to remove the chroma-key background.
5. Run `scripts/pixelize.mjs` to reduce detail and apply a palette or color limit.
6. Run `scripts/fit-canvas.mjs` to enforce the exact requested `WxH` transparent canvas.
7. Run `scripts/validate-pixel-asset.mjs` to check dimensions, alpha, transparent corners, and optional color count.
8. Save a prompt record in the source directory using `<stem>.prompt.md` unless the project has a stronger convention.

Prefer project-local equivalent tools if they already exist and satisfy the same contract. Otherwise use this skill's bundled scripts.

## Prompt Pattern

Use built-in `image_gen` by default.

```text
Use case: stylized-concept
Asset type: transparent pixel-art source image for a game object
Primary request: Create one <subject>.
Subject: <single object only>, readable silhouette, clean edges.
Style: <project style>, pixel-art friendly source image, simplified forms, broad color areas, low detail clustering.
Composition: centered isolated object, generous padding, no cropped important edges.
Background: perfectly flat solid <key-color> chroma-key background. The background must be one uniform color with no floor plane, no shadow, no gradient, no texture, and no lighting variation. Do not use <key-color> anywhere in the subject.
Color/detail constraints: compatible with reduction to <N> colors and final size <WxH>.
Avoid: photorealism, text, logos, watermark, extra props, background clutter, contact shadow, cast shadow, reflection, UI, frame, border.
```

## Commands

Examples assume the current repository layout and set `SKILL_DIR` explicitly.

```bash
SKILL_DIR=.agents/skills/generating-dot-assets
node "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/cutout.mjs" raw.png tmp/cutout.png --trim --fuzz 8%
node "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/pixelize.mjs" tmp/cutout.png tmp/pixel.png --width 96 --colors 24 --dither off
node "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/fit-canvas.mjs" tmp/pixel.png final.png --size 64x64 --fit contain --gravity center
node "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/validate-pixel-asset.mjs" final.png --size 64x64 --max-colors 24 --transparent-corners
```

With a palette:

```bash
SKILL_DIR=.agents/skills/generating-dot-assets
node "$SKILL_DIR/scripts/pixelize.mjs" tmp/cutout.png tmp/pixel.png --width 96 --palette palette.json --dither off
```

## Rules

- Do not rely on image generation to produce exact pixel dimensions.
- Do not leave final sizing to `pixelize`; always enforce the requested dimensions with `fit-canvas`.
- Use `contain` for most object assets so the subject is not cropped.
- Generate one object per image. Batches should use one built-in `image_gen` call per object.
- Keep raw generated images and final transparent PNGs separate.
- Do not overwrite existing assets unless explicitly asked; create a versioned filename instead.
- Automated validation enforces exact size, alpha, transparent corners, and maximum color count. If the design asks for a color range such as 16-24 colors, enforce the upper bound with `--max-colors` and treat the lower bound as a visual acceptance check for readability and sufficient detail.
- Default pixelize resize: use an intermediate long edge about 2x the final long edge. For square or landscape assets, set `--width` to `final_width * 2`; for portrait assets, set `--height` to `final_height * 2`. Use both `--width` and `--height` only when intentional pre-fit stretching is acceptable.

## Failure Handling

- If chroma-key removal leaves a colored fringe, retry `cutout` with a higher `--fuzz` or regenerate with more padding and stricter flat-background wording.
- If the subject is cropped, regenerate with stronger padding instructions or use a larger intermediate size.
- If the object becomes unreadable at final size, regenerate with simpler shapes or pixelize from a less detailed source.
- If ImageMagick `convert` is unavailable, report that the bundled scripts require ImageMagick and stop.
