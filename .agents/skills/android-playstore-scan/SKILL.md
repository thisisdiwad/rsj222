# Android Play Store Scanner

**ANALYSIS ONLY** - Scans your Android project and generates a comprehensive Play Console setup checklist. Does NOT modify any files.

## Overview

**Purpose:**
- Analyze project to detect app features and requirements
- Pre-fill Play Console setup answers based on code analysis
- Identify missing configurations (privacy policy, etc.)
- Generate actionable checklist for Play Console setup

**What this skill does:**
1. Scans AndroidManifest.xml for permissions and features
2. Analyzes build.gradle for SDKs and dependencies
3. Detects Health Connect, ads, analytics
4. Checks for privacy policy URL
5. Generates `PLAY_CONSOLE_SETUP.md` with pre-filled answers
6. Provides recommendations for missing items

**What this skill does NOT do:**
- ❌ Does not create or modify any project files
- ❌ Does not setup GitHub Actions or workflows
- ❌ Does not generate privacy policies (use `/devtools:privacy-policy-generate`)
- ❌ Does not configure signing or release builds

## Prerequisites

- Android project with AndroidManifest.xml
- Build configuration files (build.gradle.kts)

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Default | Description |
|-------|----------|---------|-------------|
| project_path | Yes | . | Android project root |

## Process

### Step 1: Scan AndroidManifest.xml

```bash
echo "📱 Scanning AndroidManifest.xml..."

# Get package name
PACKAGE_NAME=$(grep "package=" app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml | head -1 | sed 's/.*package="\([^"]*\)".*/\1/')
echo "  Package: $PACKAGE_NAME"

# Get app name
APP_NAME=$(grep 'name="app_name"' app/src/main/res/values/strings.xml 2>/dev/null | sed 's/.*>\([^<]*\)<.*/\1/' || echo "Unknown")
echo "  App name: $APP_NAME"

# Check permissions
echo "  Scanning permissions..."
PERMISSIONS=$(grep "<uses-permission" app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml | sed 's/.*android:name="\([^"]*\)".*/\1/')

# Detect features
INTERNET=$(echo "$PERMISSIONS" | grep -q "INTERNET" && echo "Yes" || echo "No")
LOCATION=$(echo "$PERMISSIONS" | grep -q "LOCATION" && echo "Yes" || echo "No")
CAMERA=$(echo "$PERMISSIONS" | grep -q "CAMERA" && echo "Yes" || echo "No")
HEALTH=$(echo "$PERMISSIONS" | grep -q "health.permission" && echo "Yes" || echo "No")

echo "    Internet: $INTERNET"
echo "    Location: $LOCATION"
echo "    Camera: $CAMERA"
echo "    Health Connect: $HEALTH"
```

### Step 2: Analyze Dependencies

```bash
echo "📦 Scanning build.gradle.kts..."

# Check for ads
ADS_DETECTED="No"
if grep -q "admob" app/build.gradle.kts 2>/dev/null; then
    ADS_DETECTED="Yes (AdMob)"
elif grep -q "facebook-ads" app/build.gradle.kts 2>/dev/null; then
    ADS_DETECTED="Yes (Facebook Audience Network)"
fi
echo "  Ads: $ADS_DETECTED"

# Check for analytics
ANALYTICS_DETECTED=""
grep -q "firebase-analytics" app/build.gradle.kts 2>/dev/null && ANALYTICS_DETECTED="Firebase Analytics"
grep -q "google-analytics" app/build.gradle.kts 2>/dev/null && ANALYTICS_DETECTED="${ANALYTICS_DETECTED} Google Analytics"
echo "  Analytics: ${ANALYTICS_DETECTED:-None}"

# Check for payments
PAYMENTS="No"
grep -q "billing" app/build.gradle.kts 2>/dev/null && PAYMENTS="Yes (Google Play Billing)"
echo "  In-app purchases: $PAYMENTS"

# Check for auth
AUTH_DETECTED=""
grep -q "firebase-auth" app/build.gradle.kts 2>/dev/null && AUTH_DETECTED="Firebase Auth"
grep -q "play-services-auth" app/build.gradle.kts 2>/dev/null && AUTH_DETECTED="${AUTH_DETECTED} Google Sign-In"
echo "  Authentication: ${AUTH_DETECTED:-None detected}"
```

### Step 3: Check Privacy Policy

```bash
echo "🔒 Checking for privacy policy..."

PRIVACY_POLICY_URL=""
# Check common locations
if [ -f docs/privacy-policy.md ]; then
    PRIVACY_POLICY_URL="https://$(git config remote.origin.url | sed 's/.*github.com[:/]\(.*\)\.git/\1/')/privacy-policy"
    echo "  ✓ Found: docs/privacy-policy.md"
    echo "  Suggested URL: $PRIVACY_POLICY_URL"
elif grep -q "privacy" README.md 2>/dev/null; then
    echo "  ⚠️  Privacy policy mentioned in README but not found in docs/"
else
    echo "  ❌ Privacy policy not found"
    PRIVACY_POLICY_URL="⚠️ ACTION REQUIRED"
fi
```

### Step 4: Detect Health Connect Data Types

If Health Connect is detected:

```bash
if [ "$HEALTH" = "Yes" ]; then
    echo "💚 Analyzing Health Connect integration..."

    HEALTH_DATA_TYPES=""
    grep -q "STEPS" app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml && HEALTH_DATA_TYPES="${HEALTH_DATA_TYPES}- Steps (read/write)\n"
    grep -q "HEART_RATE" app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml && HEALTH_DATA_TYPES="${HEALTH_DATA_TYPES}- Heart rate (read)\n"
    grep -q "SLEEP" app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml && HEALTH_DATA_TYPES="${HEALTH_DATA_TYPES}- Sleep sessions (read)\n"
    grep -q "EXERCISE" app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml && HEALTH_DATA_TYPES="${HEALTH_DATA_TYPES}- Exercise sessions (read/write)\n"

    echo -e "  Health data types:\n$HEALTH_DATA_TYPES"
fi
```

### Step 5: Estimate Content Rating

```bash
echo "🎯 Estimating content rating..."

# Simple heuristic - actual rating requires IARC questionnaire
ESTIMATED_RATING="Everyone (E)"

if grep -qi "violence\|weapon\|blood" app/src/main/res/values/strings.xml 2>/dev/null; then
    ESTIMATED_RATING="Teen (T) - Violence detected"
elif grep -qi "gambling\|casino\|lottery" app/src/main/res/values/strings.xml 2>/dev/null; then
    ESTIMATED_RATING="Mature (M) - Gambling detected"
fi

echo "  Estimated: $ESTIMATED_RATING"
echo "  Note: Complete official IARC questionnaire in Play Console"
```

### Step 6: Generate PLAY_CONSOLE_SETUP.md

Create comprehensive setup guide:

```markdown
# Play Console Setup Guide for: {APP_NAME}

Generated: {CURRENT_DATE}

## 8. First Upload Checklist

Before you can use automated deployments, you must manually upload your first release:

### Preparation

- [ ] Run `/devtools:android-keystore-generation` (if not done)
- [ ] Run `/devtools:android-signing-config`
- [ ] Build release AAB: `./gradlew bundleRelease`
- [ ] Verify AAB is signed: `jarsigner -verify -verbose app/build/outputs/bundle/release/app-release.aab`

### Play Console First Upload

- [ ] Go to Play Console → **Release** → **Internal testing**
- [ ] Click **Create new release**
- [ ] Upload `app-release.aab`
- [ ] Complete store listing (title, description, screenshots)
- [ ] Complete all required declarations above
- [ ] Review and publish to internal testing

### Important Notes

⚠️ **First Upload Keystore = CI Keystore**

The keystore you use for the first upload becomes your **upload key**. You must use the same keystore in CI/CD.

**After first upload:**
- Note the SHA-1 fingerprint from Play Console
- Use the same production keystore for GitHub Actions
- Do NOT generate a different keystore for CI

### Play App Signing

**How it works:**
1. First upload: Google creates the **app signing key** (permanent)
2. Your keystore becomes the **upload key** (can be reset if lost)
3. Google re-signs your AAB with the app signing key before distribution

**No action needed** - Play App Signing is automatic for new apps.

---

## 9. Next Steps

After completing the checklist above:

```bash
# Setup automated Play Store publishing
/devtools:android-playstore-setup
```

This will:
- Configure Gradle Play Publisher plugin
- Create GitHub Actions workflows
- Setup release automation

---

## 10. Track Differences

Understanding Play Store release tracks:

| Track | Audience | Use Case | Review Time |
|-------|----------|----------|-------------|
| **Internal** | Up to 100 testers | Quick testing | Instant |
| **Closed (Alpha)** | Invited testers | Beta testing | < 24h |
| **Open (Beta)** | Anyone can join | Public beta | < 24h |
| **Production** | All users | Full release | 1-7 days |

**Recommended flow:**
1. Internal → Verify app works
2. Beta → Wider testing (optional)
3. Production → Full release

---

## Validation

Run validation checks:

```bash
# Validate Play Store API connection
python3 scripts/validate-playstore.py SERVICE_ACCOUNT.json {PACKAGE_NAME}
```

Expected: ✅ All validations passed

## Verification

**MANDATORY:** Run these commands:

```bash
# Verify setup guide created
test -f PLAY_CONSOLE_SETUP.md && echo "✓ Setup guide created"

# Verify key sections present
grep -q "Privacy Policy" PLAY_CONSOLE_SETUP.md && echo "✓ Privacy policy section"
grep -q "Data Safety" PLAY_CONSOLE_SETUP.md && echo "✓ Data safety section"
grep -q "First Upload" PLAY_CONSOLE_SETUP.md && echo "✓ First upload checklist"
```

**Expected output:**
- ✓ Setup guide created
- ✓ Privacy policy section
- ✓ Data safety section
- ✓ First upload checklist

## Outputs

| Output | Location | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| Setup checklist | PLAY_CONSOLE_SETUP.md | Complete Play Console setup guide |

## What Happens Next

After reviewing `PLAY_CONSOLE_SETUP.md`:

1. **Address action items** (privacy policy, missing configs)
2. **Run setup skill:**
   ```
   /devtools:android-playstore-setup
   ```
3. This will execute the actual setup based on the checklist

## Detected vs. Actual

**This skill detects:**
- ✅ Declared permissions in manifest
- ✅ Dependencies in build.gradle
- ✅ Health Connect integration
- ✅ Common SDKs (ads, analytics)

**This skill cannot detect:**
- ❌ Runtime permission usage patterns
- ❌ Actual network calls and endpoints
- ❌ User-generated content handling
- ❌ Content rating accuracy

**Always review the generated checklist and adjust based on your actual implementation.**

## Troubleshooting

### "Package name not found"
**Cause:** AndroidManifest.xml format issue
**Fix:** Verify `package` attribute exists in `<manifest>` tag

### "No permissions detected"
**Cause:** Permissions declared in Gradle instead of manifest
**Fix:** Check build.gradle.kts for permission declarations

### "Privacy policy detection failed"
**Cause:** Privacy policy in non-standard location
**Fix:** Update scan or manually specify URL in generated checklist

## Completion Criteria

- [ ] `PLAY_CONSOLE_SETUP.md` created
- [ ] All project features detected correctly
- [ ] Privacy policy status identified
- [ ] Health Connect integration detected (if applicable)
- [ ] Action items clearly marked
- [ ] Ready to proceed with actual setup
