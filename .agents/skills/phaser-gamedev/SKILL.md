# Phaser Game Development

Build 2D browser games using Phaser 3's scene-based architecture and physics systems.

## Before Starting A New Game Or Touching An Existing One

**Read [read-before-implement.md](references/read-before-implement.md) first.** Three-layer reading order (skill docs → target game → shared helpers) and the pre-implementation output checklist. Skipping this is the #1 source of invented APIs and wrong assumptions.

**Before merging to main**, run the relevant checks in [pre-release-audit.md](references/pre-release-audit.md) — 7 reactive error signatures + 7 proactive consistency checks (asset keys, scene registration, `reloadDocument` on game links, touch-controls cleanup, viewport restart guard).

**When reaching for abstraction**, consult [game-patterns.md](references/game-patterns.md) first — it catalogs composition patterns (BehaviorManager, FSM, TurnManager, WaveManager, CardManager, DialogueManager) with explicit "when to extract" vs "stay ad-hoc" signals. Prevents premature abstraction.

## STOP: Before Loading Any Spritesheet

**Read [spritesheets-nineslice.md](references/spritesheets-nineslice.md) FIRST.**

Spritesheet loading is fragile—a few pixels off causes silent corruption that compounds into broken visuals. The reference file contains the mandatory inspection protocol.

**Quick rules** (details in reference):

1. **Measure the asset** before writing loader code—never guess frame dimensions
2. **Character sprites use SQUARE frames**: If you calculate frameWidth=56, try 56 for height first
3. **Different animations have different frame sizes**: A run cycle needs wider frames than idle; an attack needs extra width for weapon swing. Measure EACH spritesheet independently
4. **Check for spacing**: Gaps between frames require `spacing: N` in loader config
5. **Verify the math**: `imageWidth = (frameWidth × cols) + (spacing × (cols - 1))`

## Architecture Decisions (Make Early)

**Before building, decide**:

- What **scenes** does this game need? (Boot, Menu, Game, UI overlay, GameOver)
- What are the **core entities** and how do they interact?
- What **physics** model fits? (Arcade for speed, Matter for realism, None for menus)
- What **input methods**? (keyboard/gamepad/touch)

### Physics System Choice

| System     | Use When                                                               |
| ---------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Arcade** | Platformers, shooters, most 2D games. Fast AABB collisions             |
| **Matter** | Physics puzzles, ragdolls, realistic collisions. Slower, more accurate |
| **None**   | Menu scenes, visual novels, card games                                 |

---

## Core Principles

1. **Scene-first architecture**: Organize code around scene lifecycle and transitions
2. **Composition over inheritance**: Build entities from sprite/body/controllers, not deep class trees
3. **Physics-aware design**: Choose collision model early; don't retrofit physics late
4. **Asset pipeline discipline**: Preload everything; reference by keys; keep loading deterministic
5. **Frame-rate independence**: Use `delta` for motion and timers; avoid frame counting

---

## CRITICAL: Scaled Sprites + Physics Bodies

When textures are larger than display size (e.g. AI-generated assets), `body.setSize()` is multiplied by sprite scale!

**WRONG** — body becomes tiny (5px instead of 80px):

```typescript
sprite.setDisplaySize(80, 12); // scale = 80/1200 = 0.067
sprite.body.setSize(80, 12); // actual body = 80 * 0.067 = 5px!
```

**CORRECT** — use FRAME (texture) size, scale applies automatically:

```typescript
sprite.setDisplaySize(80, 12);
const body = sprite.body as Phaser.Physics.Arcade.Body;
body.setSize(sprite.frame.width, sprite.frame.height); // body = 1200 * 0.067 = 80px ✓
```

For **static bodies** (bricks, platforms), also call `updateFromGameObject()`:

```typescript
brick.setDisplaySize(40, 16);
const body = brick.body as Phaser.Physics.Arcade.StaticBody;
body.setSize(brick.frame.width, brick.frame.height);
body.updateFromGameObject(); // REQUIRED for static bodies!
```

### CRITICAL: Arcade physics bodies CANNOT rotate

`setAngle()` / `setRotation()` rotates the VISUAL sprite only. The physics body stays axis-aligned (AABB). This means rotated wall sprites have wrong collision shapes.

**WRONG** — body stays 64×32 horizontal even though sprite is rotated 90°:

```typescript
wall.setAngle(90);
wall.body.setSize(64, 32); // still horizontal!
```

**CORRECT** — separate visual from collision:

```typescript
// Visual only (no physics)
this.add.image(x, y, "wall").setAngle(90);

// Invisible collision zone
const zone = this.add.zone(x, y, 16, span);
this.physics.add.existing(zone, true); // static body
wallGroup.add(zone);
```

### Obstacle collision groups pattern

Split obstacles into separate StaticGroups when different entities need different collision rules:

```typescript
this.walls = this.physics.add.staticGroup(); // invisible zones
this.trees = this.physics.add.staticGroup(); // visible + physics

// Walls block player only (enemies walk through to enter arena)
this.physics.add.collider(this.player, this.walls);
// Trees block everyone
this.physics.add.collider(this.player, this.trees);
this.physics.add.collider(this.enemyPool, this.trees);
```

### CRITICAL: Keyboard input — canvas focus problem

**Read [keyboard-input.md](references/keyboard-input.md) for the full solution.**

Phaser's keyboard only works when canvas has focus. When embedded in a React page, canvas loses focus constantly (user clicks tabs, buttons, scrolls). `keyboard.target: window` alone does NOT fix this.

**Required**: Window-level capture-phase listener that re-focuses canvas + re-dispatches the event. Plus `addCapture(SPACE)` in each scene that uses SPACE.

---

## Graphics Overlays on Sprites (Brake Lights, Flames, Effects)

When drawing Graphics effects (brake lights, nitro flames, etc.) on top of sprite-based game objects:

### Sprite canvas ≠ car body

AI-generated sprites have transparent padding — the visible content is smaller than the PNG canvas. Always **crop sprites first** (`process_sprite` with auto-crop) so the PNG edges match the pixel art edges. Otherwise, effects positioned at `halfW`/`halfH` will float outside the visible car.

### Coordinate alignment

After `g.translateCanvas(x, y)` + `g.rotateCanvas(angle)`, the local coordinate origin is the sprite center. Position effects relative to the **display size** (which maps to cropped sprite edges):

```typescript
const halfW = CAR_DRAW_W / 2;
const halfH = CAR_DRAW_H / 2;
// Brake lights at rear corners (car body is ~55% of canvas width)
const sideX = halfW * 0.38; // actual car edge, NOT halfW
const rearY = halfH - 4; // just inside rear edge
```

### Multi-layer effects look better

- **Brake lights**: outer glow circle (large, low alpha) + inner 2×2px rect (bright)
- **Nitro flame**: 3 layers — outer (orange), mid (yellow), core (white-yellow) with sin-based flicker
- **Dual exhaust**: 2 separate small flames with independent flicker phases

### Sprite rotation offset

If a sprite faces south but `angle=0` means north: add `Math.PI` to sprite rotation, but keep Graphics `rotateCanvas(car.angle)` as-is (Graphics follow physics convention, sprite gets the visual flip).

## Variation Guidance

Outputs should vary based on:

- **Genre** (platformer vs top-down vs shmup)
- **Target platform** (mobile touch, desktop keyboard, gamepad)
- **Art style** (pixel art scaling vs HD smoothing)
- **Performance envelope** (many sprites → pooling; few sprites → simpler code)

---

## Remember

Phaser provides powerful primitives—scenes, sprites, physics, input—but **architecture is your responsibility**.

Think in systems: define the scenes, define the entities, define their interactions—then implement.

**Codex can build complete, polished Phaser games. These guidelines illuminate the path—they don't fence it.**
