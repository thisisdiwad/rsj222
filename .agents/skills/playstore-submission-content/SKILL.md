# Play Store Submission Content

Generate polished, Play Store-ready text content for your Android app submission. This skill handles all localizable fields, enforces Google's character and formatting rules, and outputs clean markdown organized by language.

## When to Use

Users ask things like:
- "Generate Play Store description for my app"
- "Write Play Store listing content"
- "Create Play Console text fields"
- "Help with Google Play Store submission"
- "Generate app listing content for Android"

Your job: gather app details, generate compelling content for all fields, and output structured markdown ready to copy-paste into Play Console.

## What Makes Strong Play Store Content

The Google Play Store has different rules than Apple's App Store. Understanding these differences is critical for rejection-free submissions.

**App Title (30 chars)**
- Weak: "My Great Task Manager App 2024"
- Strong: "Mint: Budget & Money"

**Short Description (80 chars)**
- Weak: "The best todo list app ever made with amazing features"
- Strong: "Track spending, set budgets, and reach your financial goals."

**Full Description (4000 chars)**
- Weak: "This app has many features. You can add tasks. You can check them off."
- Strong: "Mint replaces your scattered finances with a single, elegant system. Track expenses in seconds, set budgets that actually work, and get alerts when it matters. 💰 No subscription required."

**What's New (500 chars)**
- Weak: "Bug fixes and improvements"
- Strong: "Redesigned home screen with quick-add widget. Fixed bank sync issues. Added dark mode support."

## Field Reference

### Localizable Fields (per language)

| Field | Max Characters | Key Rules |
|-------|----------------|-----------|
| App Title | 30 | No emojis, no ★☆, no ALL CAPS (unless brand), no repeated punctuation, no line breaks |
| Short Description | 80 | No emojis, no symbols — first text users see in search results |
| Full Description | 4000 | **Emojis ALLOWED** — plain text only, no HTML; first ~167 chars shown before "Read More" |

## Multi-Language Detection

### How to Detect Localization in a Project

1. **Android Native:**
   - `res/values-*/strings.xml` files
   - `res/values/strings.xml` for default

2. **Flutter:**
   - `lib/l10n/*.arb` files

3. **React Native / Generic:**
   - `i18n/`, `locales/`, `translations/` directories

4. **Kotlin Multiplatform:**
   - `commonMain/resources/MR/` directory

5. **Fastlane:**
   - `fastlane/metadata/android/` subdirectories (one per locale)

### Multi-Language Workflow

1. Scan project for localization signals using the paths above
2. If localization detected → report found languages, ask user to confirm multi-language output (recommend yes)
3. If confirmed → generate all localizable fields for each detected language
4. If no localization detected → default to English (US) only

## Project Analysis Guide

### What to Extract

Before generating content, analyze the codebase to gather:

| Source | What to Look For |
|--------|-----------------|
| `build.gradle`, `app/build.gradle` | App name, package name, version |
| `AndroidManifest.xml` | App name, permissions |
| `README.md` | App description, key features |
| Source code comments | Unique selling points |
| Existing marketing materials | Brand voice, key phrases |
| `pubspec.yaml` (Flutter) | App name, description |

### Questions to Ask User

If information is missing, ask:
- What is the app's primary purpose?
- Who is the target audience?
- What are the top 3 features?
- Is there existing copy you'd like to adapt?
- What category should the app be listed under?
