class_name DirectionalSpriteResolver
extends Sprite3D

## Expert Directional Sprite Resolver (Godot 4.6).
## Calculates the 8-way (Doom/Octopath style) frame index based on camera view.

@export var camera: Camera3D
@export var character: Node3D

func _process(_delta: float) -> void:
	if not camera or not character: return
	
	# 1. Extract Forward Vectors (-Z is forward in Godot)
	var cam_forward: Vector3 = -camera.global_transform.basis.z
	var char_forward: Vector3 = -character.global_transform.basis.z
	
	# 2. Get Signed Angle around UP axis
	var angle: float = char_forward.signed_angle_to(cam_forward, Vector3.UP)
	
	# 3. Map Radians (-PI to PI) to 8 Slices (45 degrees each)
	var direction_index: int = int(round(angle / (PI / 4.0)))
	if direction_index < 0:
		direction_index += 8
		
	# 4. Set Frame (Ensure your sprite sheet is ordered 0-7 for N, NE, E, SE, etc.)
	frame = direction_index

## [SKILL NOTICE]: Use 'signed_angle_to' with Vector3.UP to accurately map 
## character orientation relative to the camera for 2.5D directional sprites.
